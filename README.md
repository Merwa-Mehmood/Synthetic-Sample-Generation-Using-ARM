Synthetic-Sample-Generation in Industrial Control Systems.
This Colab notebook demonstrates how to generate synthetic attack samples using association rule mining techniques for the SWaT testbed. The method employs an itemset generating algorithm specifically tailored to model attack scenarios. This approach helps in enhancing the robustness of security systems by simulating realistic attack patterns. 
Further details will be available in my forthcoming article, where I will elaborate on the methodology and its implications for improving cybersecurity measures. The link to the article will be added once published
